# DOTR-Memory-Patcher
 A memory patcher for the NTSC-U Version of Yu-gi-oh Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses mods.  

A simple and easy to use memory patcher for the use of mods.\
Allows for creating your own personalised modded experience as well as QOL changes.
## To use:
0: Go to [Releases](https://github.com/batzpup/DOTR-Memory-Patcher/releases) and download the most recent version of DOTRModder.zip.\
1: Extract it to a folder wherever you would like.\
2: Run DOTRModder.exe.\
3: Select the mods you wish to patch into your game and what values they should have.\
4: Press start.\
5: Open Pcsx2 and load your Duelist of the roses game.\
6: Use Boot ISO (full).\
7: Wait until the memory patcher closes.\
8: Enjoy the game with your mods.


## Notes:
This is currently in alpha there will be bugs, please report them so I can fix them.\
This is a memory patch, so the modding isnt permanent you will need to apply the patch each time you open the game.\
This will work on most pre-modded iso's (usually via [Blayrs Modding Tool](https://github.com/Blayr/DOTR-Modding-Tool)).\
Allow non monster fusions will work but you will currently need to patch the iso with said tool to adjust the fusion table (this is planned to be included into the tool later)
